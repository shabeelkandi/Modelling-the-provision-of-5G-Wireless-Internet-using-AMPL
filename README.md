SPEED Telecom would like to expand its services into the 5G network and is currently in its early planning stages. This report addresses the design requirements for SPEED Telecoms expansion into 5G Wireless network in the London region. The general problem involves deciding on an optimal network design that can serve the internet traffic demand across all zones subject to a number of other technical design specifications. Objectives The key decisions this report aims to address are the transmission capacity of each of SPEEDâ€™s main antennas and the allocating portions of the demand in each zone across its five main antennas.
